## About

**Learn** is an AI-powered learning tool that transforms your documents into smart flashcards.  
Upload PDFs or text, and the app automatically generates Q/A cards with the help of LLMs.  
A built-in spaced repetition algorithm (similar to Anki's SM-2) ensures efficient long-term retention,  
while an integrated Pomodoro timer keeps you focused during study sessions.

### Features (Planned)
- 📄 Import PDFs and text documents  
- 🤖 Automatic flashcard generation using AI  
- 🧠 Spaced repetition learning (SM-2 algorithm)  
- ⏱️ Pomodoro timer for focused sessions  
- 📊 Basic statistics & progress tracking  
- 🌐 Minimal web interface (React)  
- 💾 Local storage with SQLite  

### Roadmap
- **v0.1 – MVP**: PDF/Text → Cards → Review with SRS  
- **v0.2 – Productivity**: Pomodoro timer, study stats  
- **v0.3 – Smarter AI**: Better parsing, embeddings, export/import
